       - usingnamespace std; : it tells teh compiler touse the std namespace.
       - main() : the execution of the program begins.
       - int main() : it is the main function where the program execution begins.
       - cout<<"Hello WOrld" : this line cause the message hello world to be displayed on the screen.
       -return 0 : it terminates the main function & causes it to return the value 0 to the calling process.
       - // : this is added before a sentence to make it a comment in the code.



CONCLUSION: This program was very useful for learning the basics of C++ programming.
