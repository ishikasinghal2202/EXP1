AIM : write a C program to print Hello world & perform various calculator operators


SOFTWARE USED: VS Code


OBJECTIVE:

       - to understand basics of C++ program.
       - to learn how to use output command(std::cout).
       - to use variables and data types(int, float, char).
       - learn error handling(eg, divide by zero).


THEORY:

** C++ is often considered better than C for several reasons, primarily due to its:
       
       -object-oriented programming (OOP) features 
       -improved memory management 
       -access to a rich set of libraries 
       -While C is simpler and more lightweight
       -C++ offers more flexibility and features that can make larger, more complex projects easier to manage and maintain.


       - <iostream> : it is used to define several headers used in the program. 
       - usingnamespace std; : it tells teh compiler touse the std namespace.
       - main() : the execution of the program begins.
       - int main() : it is the main function where the program execution begins.
       - cout<<"Hello WOrld" : this line cause the message hello world to be displayed on the screen.
       - return 0 : it terminates the main function & causes it to return the value 0 to the calling process.
       - // : this is added before a sentence to make it a comment in the code.


OUTPUT: 
    for hello world code--
                          Hello, World!

    for calculator program--
                         Enter the first number:3
                         Enter the second number:2
                         Sum of given numbers:
                         5
                         The product of num1 and num2 is:
                         6
                         The division of num1 and num2 is:
                         1.5
                         The subtraction of num1 and num2 is:
                         1
                          
                          
CONCLUSION: This program was very useful for learning the basics of C++ programming.
