AIM : write a C program to print Hello world & perform various calculator operators


SOFTWARE USED: VS Code


OBJECTIVE:

       - to understand basics of C++ program.
       - to learn how to use output command(std::cout).
       - to use variables and data types(int, float, char).
       - learn error handling(eg, divide by zero).


THEORY:- <iostream> : it is used to define several headers used in the program. 
       - usingnamespace std; : it tells teh compiler touse the std namespace.
       - main() : the execution of the program begins.
       - int main() : it is the main function where the program execution begins.
       - cout<<"Hello WOrld" : this line cause the message hello world to be displayed on the screen.
       -return 0 : it terminates the main function & causes it to return the value 0 to the calling process.
       - // : this is added before a sentence to make it a comment in the code.


OUTPUT: 
    for hello world code--
                          Hello World

    for calculator program--
                          Enter the first number: 8
                          Enter the second number: 4
                          Sum of the given numbers: 12
                          The product of num1 and num2: 32
                          The division of num1 and num2: 2
                          The subraction of num1 and num2: 4
                          
                          
CONCLUSION: This program was very useful for learning the basics of C++ programming.
